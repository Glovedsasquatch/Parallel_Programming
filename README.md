# Parallel_Programming
# -------------------------------- OBJECTIVE -------------------------------
After the painful experience of failing to act systematically sequentially even after reading a very useful
yet life sucking course of Parallel Programming, I was bound to create this document (especially because it 
helped me remember stuffs better, but time shall say, since results are yet to be out). 

Keeping the course content as the reference, I have tried to detail things to the best of my understanding
using points of reference off the internet. Please use it if you feel it of some use to you and add to the
information/content if you can.
